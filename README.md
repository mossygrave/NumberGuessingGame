# NumberGuessingGame

# Overview

This project is a simple command-line number-guessing game written in Java. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user attempts to guess it. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user correctly identifies the number. This project aims to improve Java programming skills, including user input handling, loops, conditionals, and basic program structure.

This project serves as an introduction to interactive console applications and strengthens understanding of fundamental programming concepts such as control flow, randomness, and input validation.
